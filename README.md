The malware industry is an ever-growing, well-funded problem showing no signs of slowing down. An infected host is at risk of personal data loss and hardware takeover. Companies such as Microsoft have been working to build software solutions to detect and remove malware from a host. Utilizing Microsoft’s data set of nearly ten million personal computers, I set out to see if I can determine if a computer is infected, or likely to become infected, based on system information without the need to scan files. All antivirus solutions on the market scan files to determine if malware needs to be removed; If I can develop a flag to notify the software of the vulnerability I can scan less frequently, allowing the host machine to free resources.
The dataset provided is primed to be read into a dense neural network or a convolutional neural network. Utilizing both models will help us raise a flag when a host machine is nearing peak vulnerability.
My results determined an accuracy of roughly sixty-five to seventy percent that the host machine was likely to be infected soon.
